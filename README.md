# Deloitte-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
Data Analytics virtual internship tasks by Deloitte via Forage.

## Overview
This repository contains my work from the Data Analytics Job Simulation offered by Deloitte through Forage.  
The internship involved analysing machine telemetry data and building dashboards to identify downtime patterns.

## Task 1: Machine Downtime Analysis

### Objective
To determine:
1. Which factory experienced the most machine downtime.
2. Which device types contributed most to the downtime.

### Approach
- Imported telemetry JSON data into Tableau.
- Created a calculated field called **"Unhealthy"** to represent downtime.
- Built two visualizations:
  - Down Time per Factory
  - Down Time per Device Type
- Created an interactive dashboard where selecting a factory filters device downtime.

### Key Insights
- **Seiko Factory** experienced the highest machine downtime.
- The **LaserWelder** device type contributed the most to downtime.

## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau
- Data Visualization
- Data Analysis
